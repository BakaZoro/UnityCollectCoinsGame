# UnityCollectCoinsGame

A simple 2D Unity game where the player can control the character using arrow keys. Coins appear randomly in the area and upon colelcting coins, scores get updated.
Edit: I believe the score gets updated as +2 on collecting a single coin. I didn't get time to correct it, so kindly do it. 

P.S: This game goes on till infinity :P
